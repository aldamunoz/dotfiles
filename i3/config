##-- General Settings --------------------------

## Floating Modifier
##
## To move floating windows with your mouse, you can either grab their titlebar 
## or configure the so-called floating modifier which you can then press and click
## anywhere in the window itself to move it.
##
## When holding the floating modifier, you can resize a floating window by pressing 
## the right mouse button on it and moving around while holding it.
## If you hold the shift button as well, the resize will be proportional
## (the aspect ratio will be preserved).
floating_modifier $MOD

#------

## Orientation for new workspaces
##
## New workspaces get a reasonable default orientation: Wide-screen monitors 
## (anything wider than high) get horizontal orientation, rotated monitors 
## (anything higher than wide) get vertical orientation.
##
## Syntax: default_orientation horizontal|vertical|auto
default_orientation auto

#------

## Layout mode for new containers
##
## This option determines in which mode new containers on workspace level will start.
##
## Syntax: workspace_layout default|stacking|tabbed
workspace_layout default

#------

## Window title alignment
##
## This option determines the window titleâ€™s text alignment. Default is left
##
## Syntax: title_align left|center|right
title_align center

## Print all window titles in format of 'class | title'
for_window [class=".*"] title_format "%class | %title"

## Enable window icons for all windows
for_window [all] title_window_icon off

# move tiling windows via drag & drop by left-clicking into the title bar,
# or left-clicking anywhere into the window while holding the floating modifier.
tiling_drag modifier titlebar

#------

## Hiding borders adjacent to the screen edges
##
## You can hide container borders adjacent to the screen edges using `hide_edge_borders`
## (the default is none). Hiding borders is useful if you are using scrollbars, 
## or do not want to waste even two pixels in displayspace.
##
## The `smart` setting hides borders on workspaces with only one window visible, 
## but keeps them on workspaces with multiple windows visible.
##
## The `smart_no_gaps` setting hides edge-specific borders of a container if the
## container is the only container on its workspace and the gaps to the screen edge are 0.
##
## Syntax: hide_edge_borders none|vertical|horizontal|both|smart|smart_no_gaps
hide_edge_borders none

#------

## Focus follows mouse
##
## By default, window focus follows your mouse movements as the mouse crosses window borders.
## However, if you have a setup where your mouse usually is in your way 
## (like a touchpad on your laptop which you do not want to disable completely),
## you might want to disable `focus follows mouse` and control focus only by using your keyboard.
## The mouse will still be useful inside the currently active window (for example to click on links in your browser window).
##
## Syntax: focus_follows_mouse yes|no
focus_follows_mouse yes

#------

## Mouse warping
##
## By default, when switching focus to a window on a different output 
## (e.g. focusing a window on workspace 3 on output VGA-1, coming from workspace 2 on LVDS-1),
## the mouse cursor is warped to the center of that window.
##
## With the `mouse_warping` option, you can control when the mouse cursor should be warped. 
## `none` disables warping entirely, whereas `output` is the default behavior described above.
##
## Syntax: mouse_warping output|none
mouse_warping none

#------

## Popups during fullscreen mode
##
## When you are in fullscreen mode, some applications still open popup windows (take Xpdf for example).
## This is because these applications might not be aware that they are in fullscreen mode 
## (they do not check the corresponding hint).
## There are three things which are possible to do in this situation.
##
## Syntax: popup_during_fullscreen smart|ignore|leave_fullscreen
popup_during_fullscreen smart

#------

## Delaying urgency hint reset on workspace change
##
## If an application on another workspace sets an urgency hint, switching to this 
## workspace might lead to immediate focus of the application, which also means the 
## window decoration color would be immediately reset to `client.focused`. 
## This might make it unnecessarily hard to tell which window originally raised the event.
##
## In order to prevent this, you can tell i3 to delay resetting the urgency state by
## a certain time using the `force_display_urgency_hint` directive.
## Setting the value to 0 disables this feature. The default is 500ms.
##
## Syntax: force_display_urgency_hint <timeout> ms
force_display_urgency_hint 500 ms

#------

## Focus on window activation
##
## If a window is activated, e.g., via `google-chrome www.google.com`, it may request to take focus.
## Since this might not be preferable, different reactions can be configured.
##
## Note that this might not affect windows that are being opened. 
## To prevent new windows from being focused.
##
## Syntax: focus_on_window_activation smart|urgent|focus|none
focus_on_window_activation smart

#------

## Drawing marks on window decoration
##
## If activated, marks on windows are drawn in their window decoration. 
## However, any mark starting with an underscore in its name (_) will not be drawn
## even if this option is activated.
##
## The default for this option is yes.
##
## Syntax: show_marks yes|no
show_marks yes

#------

## Tiling drag
##
## You can configure how to initiate the tiling drag feature.
##
## Syntax:
#tiling_drag off
#tiling_drag modifier|titlebar [modifier|titlebar]
tiling_drag modifier titlebar

##-- Autostart ---------------------------------

## Automatically starting applications on i3 startup
##
## By using the `exec` keyword outside a keybinding, you can configure which commands
## will be performed by i3 on initial startup. `exec` commands will not run when 
## restarting i3, if you need a command to run also when restarting i3 you should
## use the `exec_always` keyword. These commands will be run in order.
##
## Syntax:
#exec [--no-startup-id] <command>
#exec_always [--no-startup-id] <command>
exec_always --no-startup-id xrandr --output HDMI-1-0 --auto --primary --left-of eDP-1
exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/scripts/i3_autostart
